# Event Manager API Improvements

## Project Overview
This project enhances the Event Manager API by improving validation and test coverage. The API is a FastAPI-based application with JWT authentication that demonstrates robust user management functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Username Validation
Added comprehensive validation for usernames:
- Length constraints (3-30 characters)
- Character restrictions (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens only)
- Consecutive special character prevention
- Start/end character validation
- Reserved word checks

### 2. Password Validation
Implemented robust password security:
- Minimum length requirement (8 characters)
- Complexity rules:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Common password detection
- Sequential character pattern prevention

### 3. Profile Field Edge Case Handling
Enhanced validation for profile fields:
- URL validation with protocol checking
- Empty string handling
- Multiple field update consistency
- Length validation for fields like bio

### 4. Email Service Tests
Fixed email-related test failures:
- Implemented mock SMTP client
- Added proper test isolation
- Created appropriate fixtures for token-based tests

### 5. Test Coverage Improvements
- Increased overall test coverage from 81% to 87%
- Added 15+ new test cases
- Reached 100% coverage in critical modules:
  - jwt_service.py
  - smtp_connection.py
  - common.py
  - link_generation.py
  - template_manager.py
  - user_model.py

## Challenges Addressed
- **Email Service Mocking**: Implemented proper mocking to avoid actual email sending during tests
- **Token Authentication**: Created fixtures to properly test protected endpoints
- **Edge Cases**: Added validation for unexpected inputs and boundary conditions

## Future Improvements
- Further increase test coverage to reach 90%+ target
- Add more tests for user_routes.py (currently at 51% coverage)
- Implement additional integration tests
